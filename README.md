# BostonHousing-Using-Linear-Regression-Ridge-Lasso-Elastic-Net

In this repository, We have implemented a machine learning project that predicts house prices in Boston. The project covers several key topics: Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering (including feature scaling and transformation to achieve normal distribution), addressing multicollinearity, and feature selection. The dataset has been trained using multiple regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net Regression.
